//  METHODS

/*
    TO DO TOGETHER: Write a public static method called orderFood that
    prints the message "I would like fries please."
 */

/*
    TO DO: Create a main method in this class. Use it to call your
    orderFood method. Run the program to see the results.
 */

/*
    TO DO: Write a public static method called favoriteSong that prints
    your favorite song.
 */

/*
    TO DO: Write a public static method called weeksIn that prints
    message saying how many weeks you've been at Codeup.
 */

//  METHOD OVERLOADING

/*
    TO DO TOGETHER: Overload your orderFood method. Create a version that
    takes in one String parameter which can replace the item they are
    ordering.
 */

/*
    TO DO: Overload orderFood again. Create a version that takes in two
    parameters: a String replacing the item being ordered, and an int that
    represents how many of the item they would like to order. Display a new
    message using these arguments.
 */

/*
    TO DO TOGETHER: We'll overload orderFood again. We'll still have two
    parameters in this new version, however they will both be Strings
    representing two different items the customer wants. Let's display a
    new message reflecting the change.
 */

//  RECURSION

/*
    BONUS: Take a look at the Fibonacci sequence. Write a
    recursive method that accepts an int argument representing the number
    or results printed out following the Fibonacci sequence.

    For example:

    fibonacci(5) would print -> 0 1 1 2 3
    fibonacci(10) would print -> 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
 */

// HINT: The recursive method should return an int for each number in the series

// HINT: you may need an additional method using a for loop to actually print
// each number
